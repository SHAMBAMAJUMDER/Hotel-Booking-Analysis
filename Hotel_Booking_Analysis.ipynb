        "#### Data Manipulations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
        "   - **Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values by either imputing them with appropriate values or removing rows/columns with excessive missing data.\n",
        "   - **Duplicates**: Checked for and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "   - **Data Types**: Ensured correct data types for each column (e.g., converting categorical columns to category type, numerical columns to integer/float).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - **New Features**: Created new features to enhance analysis:\n",
        "     - `total_nights`: Sum of `stays_in_weekend_nights` and `stays_in_week_nights`.\n",
        "     - `total_guests`: Sum of `adults`, `children`, and `babies`.\n",
        "   - **Date Features**: Extracted more detailed date features (e.g., day of the week) from the `arrival_date` columns to analyze booking patterns more precisely.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Transformation**:\n",
        "   - **Scaling**: Scaled numerical features such as `lead_time`, `adr`, and `total_guests` to standardize the data for certain analyses (e.g., clustering).\n",
        "   - **Encoding**: Converted categorical features to numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding for machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
        "   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical features.\n",
        "   - **Distribution Analysis**: Visualized distributions of key variables using histograms and KDE plots.\n",
        "   - **Correlation Analysis**: Computed correlation matrix and visualized it using a heatmap to identify relationships between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cancellation Rates**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: Higher lead times are associated with higher cancellation rates. Customers who book far in advance are more likely to cancel.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Implement strategies to reduce cancellations for bookings made well in advance, such as offering incentives for confirmed bookings.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Seasonality and Booking Patterns**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: Booking patterns vary significantly by month, with peaks during holiday seasons and summer months.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Adjust pricing strategies and marketing efforts to capitalize on peak seasons and manage off-peak periods effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Customer Demographics**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: The majority of guests come from a few key countries, with significant differences in booking behavior and preferences across regions.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Tailor marketing campaigns and service offerings to cater to the preferences of guests from these key countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: ADR varies by room type, booking channel, and customer segment. Direct bookings tend to have higher ADR compared to third-party bookings.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Optimize room pricing and channel management strategies to maximize revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Special Requests and Guest Satisfaction**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: Guests who make special requests tend to have higher satisfaction and are more likely to return.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Enhance the process of handling special requests to improve guest experiences and encourage repeat bookings.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Distribution Channels and Market Segments**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: Different distribution channels and market segments exhibit distinct booking patterns and profitability levels.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Focus on the most profitable channels and segments, and develop targeted strategies for less profitable ones to improve overall efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Room Type and Allocation**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: There is sometimes a mismatch between the reserved and assigned room types, which can affect guest satisfaction.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Improve the room allocation process to ensure guests receive their preferred room types, enhancing their overall experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Length of Stay**:\n",
        "   - **Insight**: Longer stays are associated with certain customer segments and distribution channels.\n",
        "   - **Business Impact**: Develop packages and promotions to encourage longer stays, especially during off-peak periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "By performing these data manipulations and analyses, we gain valuable insights that can guide strategic decision-making to enhance the hotel's operations, marketing, and customer service, ultimately driving higher revenue and customer satisfaction."
